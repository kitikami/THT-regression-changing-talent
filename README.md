These files help explain the math used in my article "Regression with Changing Talent Levels: the Effects of Variance" on the Hardball Times website.
The PDF document contains a mathematical explanation of how to derive the formula used in the article to calculate changes in talent variance over time.
The R document provides some code for the statistical program R to use simulation to verify the results of said formula, as well as code to test the methods for estimating the day-to-day talent correlation from the simulated data.
